# bootcamp-portfolio

Website for a work portfolio. More work does need to be done. Took me some time to understand how nesting flex boxes works. I also learned there is a grid option for organizing a web page but I don't think it scales as well as Flex from the quick reading I did.

Also, git is confusing still.
